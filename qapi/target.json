# @query-cpu-model-comparison:
#
# Compares two CPU models, returning how they compare in a specific
# configuration. The results indicates how both models compare regarding
# runnability. This result can be used by tooling to make decisions if a
# certain CPU model will run in a certain configuration or if a compatible
# CPU model has to be created by baselining.
#
# Usually, a CPU model is compared against the maximum possible CPU model
# of a certain configuration (e.g. the "host" model for KVM). If that CPU
# model is identical or a subset, it will run in that configuration.
#
# The result returned by this command may be affected by:
#
# * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the QEMU version.
#   (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
# * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the machine-type.
#   (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
# * machine options (including accelerator): in some architectures, CPU models
#   may look different depending on machine and accelerator options. (Except for
#   CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
# * "-cpu" arguments and global properties: arguments to the -cpu option and
#   global properties may affect expansion of CPU models. Using
#   query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is not advised.
#
# Some architectures may not support comparing CPU models. s390x supports
# comparing CPU models.
#
# Returns: a CpuModelBaselineInfo. Returns an error if comparing CPU models is
#          not supported, if a model cannot be used, if a model contains
#          an unknown cpu definition name, unknown properties or properties
#          with wrong types.

# Note: this command isn't specific to s390x, but is only implemented
# on this architecture currently.

##
# @query-cpu-model-baseline:
#
# Baseline two CPU models, creating a compatible third model. The created
# model will always be a static, migration-safe CPU model (see "static"
# CPU model expansion for details).
#
# This interface can be used by tooling to create a compatible CPU model out
# two CPU models. The created CPU model will be identical to or a subset of
# both CPU models when comparing them. Therefore, the created CPU model is
# guaranteed to run where the given CPU models run.
#
# The result returned by this command may be affected by:
#
# * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the QEMU version.
#   (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
# * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the machine-type.

# @query-cpu-model-expansion:
#
# Expands a given CPU model (or a combination of CPU model + additional options)
# to different granularities, allowing tooling to get an understanding what a
# specific CPU model looks like in QEMU under a certain configuration.
#
# This interface can be used to query the "host" CPU model.
#
# The data returned by this command may be affected by:
#
# * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the QEMU version.
#   (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
# * machine-type: CPU model  may look different depending on the machine-type.

#   query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is not advised.
#
# Some architectures may not support all expansion types. s390x supports
# "full" and "static".
#
# Returns: a CpuModelExpansionInfo. Returns an error if expanding CPU models is
#          not supported, if the model cannot be expanded, if the model contains
#          an unknown CPU definition name, unknown properties or properties
#          with a wrong type. Also returns an error if an expansion type is
#          not supported.
