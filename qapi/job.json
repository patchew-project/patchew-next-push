# @JobType:

# @commit: block commit job type, see "block-commit"
#
# @stream: block stream job type, see "block-stream"

# @mirror: drive mirror job type, see "drive-mirror"

##
# @JobStatus:
#
# Indicates the present state of a given job in its lifetime.
#
# @undefined: Erroneous, default state. Should not ever be visible.
#
# @created: The job has been created, but not yet started.
#
# @running: The job is currently running.
#
# @paused: The job is running, but paused. The pause may be requested by
#          either the QMP user or by internal processes.
#
# @ready: The job is running, but is ready for the user to signal completion.
#         This is used for long-running jobs like mirror that are designed to
#         run indefinitely.
#
# @standby: The job is ready, but paused. This is nearly identical to @paused.
#           The job may return to @ready or otherwise be canceled.
#
# @waiting: The job is waiting for other jobs in the transaction to converge
#           to the waiting state. This status will likely not be visible for
#           the last job in a transaction.
#
# @pending: The job has finished its work, but has finalization steps that it
#           needs to make prior to completing. These changes may require
#           manual intervention by the management process if manual was set
#           to true. These changes may still fail.
#
# @aborting: The job is in the process of being aborted, and will finish with
#            an error. The job will afterwards report that it is @concluded.
#            This status may not be visible to the management process.
#
# @concluded: The job has finished all work. If manual was set to true, the job
#             will remain in the query list until it is dismissed.
#
# @null: The job is in the process of being dismantled. This state should not
#        ever be visible externally.
#
# Since: 2.12
