 * QEMU interface:

 *   microseconds.
 * + Property "period_filtered_us": Time between two unbiased values in
 *   microseconds.
 * + sysbus MMIO regions 0: Memory Region with tasks, events and registers
 *   to be mapped to the peripherals instance address by the SOC.
 * + Named GPIO output "irq": Interrupt line of the peripheral. Must be
 *   connected to the associated peripheral interrupt line of the NVIC.
 * + Named GPIO output "eep_valrdy": Event set when new random value is ready
 *   to be read.
 * + Named GPIO input "tep_start": Task that triggers start of continuous
 *   generation of random values.
 * + Named GPIO input "tep_stop": Task that ends continuous generation of
 *   random values.
 *
 * Accuracy of the peripheral model:
 * + Stochastic properties of different configurations of the random source
 *   are not modeled.
 * + Generation of unfiltered and filtered random values take at least the
 *   average generation time stated in the production specification;
 *   non-deterministic generation times are not modeled.
